== Description

The final project consists of a semester-long collaborative project developed for the _CI-0136 Software Design_ course. It is a **RESTful API backend** written in Python using the Flask library, which serves as a digital recipe book.

The application provides a web API for clients (like Postman or a frontend application) to perform *CRUD* operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of recipes. The development focus is on core software design principles such as *SOLID*, modularity, testing, clean code architecture, and the implementation of common *design patterns*.

As a backend service with no built-in graphical user interface (UI), the emphasis is placed on designing a well-structured, logical API.

== Repository Rules & Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process for all teams, the following *rules* have been established and must be adhered to by all contributors.

=== Branching Strategy

* *Branch Naming Convention*: All feature branches must be named using the pattern `<team-name>-<feature>`.
+
Example: `team-alpha-add-recipe`
* *Base Branches*:
** `main`: Represents the *production-ready* state of the project. Direct commits are forbidden.
** `dev`: The main development branch where feature branches are merged for integration. All work is merged here before proceeding to `main`.

=== Pull Request (PR) Process

1.  **Creation**: Once a feature is complete, open a Pull Request from your feature branch (`team-alpha-my-feature`) targeting the `dev` branch.
2.  *Review Requirements*:
    * Every PR *must be reviewed and approved* by at least one member from *each* of the other teams before it can be merged.
    * Each team is responsible for assigning a dedicated member to review PRs from other teams in a timely manner.
3.  *Definition of Done (DoD)*: A feature is considered complete and a PR can be merged only when it satisfies all following criteria:
    * The code fulfills the Acceptance Criteria for the user story/feature.
    * All new code is covered by passing unit tests.
    * All existing tests continue to pass.
    * The code follows the project's coding standards (see below).
    * The PR has received the required approvals.

=== Coding & Collaboration Standards

* *Language*: All code, comments, commit messages, and documentation within the repository must be written in *English*. The use of "Spanglish" or other mixed languages is to be avoided to maintain consistency.
* *Python Style*: All Python code must adhere to the `PEP 8` style guide. Use linters and formatters to ensure compliance.
* *Commit Messages*: Write clear, descriptive commit messages (for example: "Add feature to delete recipes" instead of "Added feature").
* *Testing*: Tests are mandatory. Strive for meaningful tests with high coverage.
